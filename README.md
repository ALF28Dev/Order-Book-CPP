# C++ Based Order Book

Hey everyone, thank you for taking the time to view this repository. This is my C++ based order book project, which I used as an opportunity to learn some basic C++ and fundamental concepts related to market microstructure. The project aims to replicate core functionalities of one of the cornerstone components of an exchange: the order book. I used the included [LOBSTER](https://lobsterdata.com/) readme txt file to learn about what information is associated with every order in an order book on an exchange.
